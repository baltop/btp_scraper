# Software Development Plan: BTP Scraper

**Version 1.0**

**Date: 2025-06-26**

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software development plan for the BTP Scraper project. The project is a Python-based web scraping application designed to extract data from various institutional and governmental websites. This plan details the project's architecture, development processes, and future roadmap to guide ongoing maintenance and feature development.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1. Objective

The primary objective of the BTP Scraper is to automate the collection of public announcements, business support information, and other relevant data from a configurable list of websites. The collected data is intended for analysis and integration with other systems.

### 2.2. Core Technologies

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
    *   `BeautifulSoup4`: For parsing HTML and XML.
    *   `Playwright`: For interacting with dynamic websites that require JavaScript rendering.
    *   `PyYAML`: For managing site configurations.
*   **Development Environment:** The project is managed using `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file for dependency management.

## 3. System Architecture

The application is designed with a modular and extensible architecture.

*   **`main.py` (Orchestrator):** This is the main entry point of the application. It reads the `sites_config.yaml` file, dynamically imports the appropriate scraper modules, and executes their `scrape` methods in a sequential manner.

*   **`enhanced_base_scraper.py` (Abstract Base Class):** This file defines the `BaseScraper` class, which serves as a template for all individual scrapers. It provides common functionalities such as:
    *   A standardized interface (`scrape` method).
    *   Helper methods for common tasks (e.g., fetching pages, handling errors).
    *   A consistent structure for returning scraped data.

*   **`enhanced_*_scraper.py` (Scraper Modules):** Each file represents a specific scraper for a single target website. These modules contain a class that inherits from `BaseScraper` and implements the site-specific logic for navigating the website and extracting the required data.

*   **`sites_config.yaml` (Configuration):** This YAML file acts as the central configuration for the application. It defines which scrapers to run, their module paths, and any site-specific parameters. This allows for easy activation or deactivation of scrapers without code changes.

*   **`pyproject.toml` & `requirements.txt` (Dependency Management):** These files specify the project's dependencies, ensuring a reproducible environment.

## 4. Development Process

### 4.1. Adding a New Scraper

1.  **Create the Scraper File:** Create a new Python file named `enhanced_<sitename>_scraper.py`.
2.  **Implement the Scraper Class:**
    *   Import the `BaseScraper` class.
    *   Define a new class that inherits from `BaseScraper`.
    *   Implement the `scrape` method, which contains the core logic for fetching and parsing data from the target site.
3.  **Update Configuration:** Add a new entry to `sites_config.yaml` with the scraper's name, module path, and any other necessary configuration.
4.  **Testing:** Create a corresponding test file (e.g., `test_enhanced_<sitename>.py`) to verify the scraper's functionality.

### 4.2. Modifying an Existing Scraper

1.  **Identify the Module:** Locate the relevant `enhanced_*_scraper.py` file.
2.  **Modify the Logic:** Update the `scrape` method or other helper functions within the class to reflect changes in the target website's structure or to fix bugs.
3.  **Run Tests:** Execute the associated tests to ensure the changes have not introduced regressions.

### 4.3. Running the Application

The scrapers are executed by running the main script from the command line:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 5. Testing Strategy

The project currently has a limited set of tests. To improve reliability and maintainability, the following testing strategy is recommended:

*   **Unit Tests:** Each scraper module should have a corresponding unit test file. These tests should mock HTTP requests and provide sample HTML content to verify that the parsing logic works as expected.
*   **Integration Tests:** A suite of integration tests should be developed to run scrapers against live websites. These tests should be run periodically to detect when a website's structure has changed.
*   **Test Framework:** `pytest` is recommended as the primary testing framework due to its simplicity and powerful features.

## 6. Future Roadmap

### 6.1. Short-Term Goals

*   **Enhanced Error Handling & Logging:** Implement a centralized logging mechanism to capture errors from all scrapers, including HTTP errors, parsing errors, and data validation failures.
*   **Data Validation:** Introduce a data validation layer (e.g., using `pydantic`) to ensure that the scraped data conforms to a predefined schema before being saved.
*   **Refactor `main.py` for Concurrency:** Modify the main execution loop to run scrapers concurrently using `asyncio` or `multiprocessing`. This will significantly reduce the total execution time.

### 6.2. Medium-Term Goals

*   **Database Integration:** Instead of outputting to CSV files, integrate a database (such as SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store the scraped data. This will allow for more robust data management and querying.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement a monitoring system to track the status of scraper runs and send alerts when failures are detected.

### 6.3. Long-Term Goals

*   **Web-based UI:** Develop a simple web interface (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to provide a dashboard for monitoring scraper status, viewing collected data, and managing scraper configurations.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Allow for the dynamic reloading of the `sites_config.yaml` file without restarting the application.
*   **Distributed Scraping:** For large-scale scraping, explore a distributed architecture using a task queue like Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ.
