# KBAN Scraper Debug Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Main Parsing Issue: Skipping Valid Announcements
**Problem**: The scraper was finding 23 rows but parsing 0 announcements because it was skipping all "공지" (notice) entries.

**Root Cause**: 
```python
# Lines 93-94 in original code
if not number or number in ['공지', 'Notice']:
    continue  # This was skipping all valid announcements!
```

**Fix**: Only skip empty numbers or header rows:
```python
if not number or number in ['번호', 'No']:
    continue
```

### 2. JavaScript Pattern Matching Issue
**Problem**: Looking for `onclick` attribute instead of `href` attribute.

**Root Cause**: The doAction JavaScript calls are in `href` attributes, not `onclick`.

**Fix**: Changed from `onclick_attr.get('onclick', '')` to `link_elem.get('href', '')`

### 3. Content Quality Issue: Poor Detail Page Extraction  
**Problem**: Content extraction was only getting navigation/page structure instead of actual announcement content.

**Root Cause**: KBAN uses iframe-based content structure that wasn't being properly extracted.

**Analysis**: 
- Detail pages use iframe: `/jsp/ext/etc/cmm_9002.jsp?BBS_NO=3022`
- Iframe contains the actual announcement content
- Table structure was 1-cell per row, not 2-cells as expected

**Fix**: 
1. Improved iframe detection and extraction
2. Fixed table cell iteration logic
3. Added iframe URL fetching with session management
4. Added proper image and link URL conversion
